# Setup

## Pre-requisite Software

* [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/#download-wrapper) is recommended but the minimum requirement is [PHP 5.4](http://windows.php.net/download/) for running Composer

---

## Code Installation

* Download and unzip to your WAMP's `www` directory placing all code within a `gulp-starter` directory
  * Or change `localProjectBaseDir` in `config.json` to whatever directory name you have chosen to use
  * Other path variables exist in `config.json` but take care when modifying these
* If instead you choose to clone this repo using the GitHub client, copy the contents of this repo to your WAMP's `www` directory (placing all code within a `gulp-starter` directory)
  * This way your cloned copy can remain clean
    * Should you choose to use this repo for other projects simply repeat the process of copying the cloned repo to a new location
* Drop all code that requires pre-processing (so fonts, images, JavaScript and CSS) into the `/app` directory adhering to the following structure
  * Everything else can go into `/public_html`
    * So `*.html`, `*.php`, etc.

### Directory Structure

```
/gulp-starter
    /app
        /fonts
        /images
        /scripts
        /styles
    /bower_components
    /composer_plugins
        phpcs-ruleset.xml
        phpmd-ruleset.xml
    /node_modules
    /public_html
        *.html
        *.php
    /secure
        private
```

---

## File Configuration

* All script tags linking to a local source should be removed - from your footer where they should be - and replaced with one, single call
  * `/public_html/scripts/all.min.js` is all JavaScript stored in `/app/scripts` concatenated into one file
```html
<script src="scripts/all.min.js"></script>
```

### Optional tasks if you wish to setup for working remotely

* Assuming you have configured your remote web server for [SSH access](http://kb.site5.com/shell-access-ssh/how-to-generate-ssh-keys-and-connect-to-your-account-with-putty/)
  * Add your private SSH key file to `/secure` and name the file `private` (without any extension)
    * Remember it must be in the OpenSSH format
        * [puttygen](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/puttygen.exe) can export into this format
* Change `webAccount` in `config.json` to that of your remote `development` web account
  * e.g. `wdu999`
* Amend `.ftppass` to contain the passphrase linked to your SSH details and the user/web account you want to SFTP into
    * The web account set for `development` should be the same as that set for `webAccount` in `config.json` (as ^above^)
    * Define the details of your `production` environment in the same way you have done for `development`
    * For info, by default uploads are transferred to `public_html` on the remote web server no matter what environment is used
* Change `symbolicLink` in `config.json` to that set for your `production` environment
  * e.g. `medi-cal` (which corresponds to http://www.abdn.ac.uk/medi-cal/)

---

## Node.js Installation

* Install Node.js - http://nodejs.org/download/ (Windows Installer)
* To check your installation is configured properly, open a terminal and type in `node --version`
  * This should return a version number at or above `0.10.x`

---

## Composer Installation

* Install Composer - https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe
  * You may need to enable OpenSSL in your PHP installation by going directly to `./wamp/bin/php/php-5.4.x/php.ini` and enabling the OpenSSL extension
* Double-click `composer-installs.bat` to run the installation
  * Ensure that setup completes successfully
* To check your installation is configured properly, open a terminal and type in `composer --version`
  * This should return a long hash similar to `28c65b5425f7f8722c260e3787b74c1ea6b37e3b`

---

## Gulp Installation

* Double-click `npm-installs.bat` to run the installation
  * Ensure that setup completes successfully
* To check your installation is configured properly, open a terminal and type in `gulp --version`
  * This should return a version number at or above `3.5.x`

---

## Choose how you want to work

Working **locally**

```sh
$ gulp
```

  * Open the terminal within your project directory - leave this prompt open after execution
  * This task will build everything and push it to `/public_html`
    * `gulp` will open up Chrome to this page - keep this page open
  * Begin coding as you normally would and any changes to your code will be mimicked in your browser without having to reload the page

Working **remotely** in your `development` environment

```sh
$ gulp upload
```

  * Open the terminal within your project directory - leave this prompt open after execution
    * This command uses the `development` environmental details specified in `.ftppass`
    * To form a URL it combines `remoteBaseDevUrl` ('homepages') with `webAccount` as set in `config.json`
  * This will build everything and push the code in `/public_html` to your development web server following the same directory structure
    * `gulp` will open up Chrome to this page - keep this page open
  * Begin coding as you normally would pressing `Ctrl + F5` to view your file changes

Working **remotely** in your `production` environment

```sh
$ gulp upload --production
```

  * Open the terminal within your project directory - leave this prompt open after execution
    * This command uses the `production` environmental details specified in `.ftppass`
    * To form a URL it changes to use `remoteBaseProdUrl` ('www') combined with `symbolicLink` as set in `config.json`
    * It also fully minifies and obfuscates JavaScript and removes all console logging whilst preserving license comment blocks
  * This will build everything and push the code in `/public_html` to your production web server following the same directory structure
    * `gulp` will open up Chrome to this page - keep this page open
  * Begin coding as you normally would pressing `Ctrl + F5` to view your file changes

## Other `gulp` Tasks

* [View workflow diagram](https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/embeddedchart/4ff39dc5-3ddf-418a-a96b-f5e1460dd77e/0)

```sh
$ gulp csslint
$ gulp jshint
$ gulp stats
$ gulp phpcs
$ gulp phpmd
$ gulp phpcpd
$ gulp screenshots
$ gulp pagespeed
$ gulp bower
```

* You can also create separate task files within the `/tasks` folder (e.g. `/tasks/example.js`) which will be read in automatically and available to run on the command line

---

## Rule Configuration Files

* `.htmlhintrc`
  * Contains [rules](https://github.com/yaniswang/HTMLHint/wiki/Rules) (in JSON format) for checking HTML files
  * Open a terminal within your project directory and type in `gulp htmlhint` to run the associated task
* `.jscsrc`
  * Contains [rules](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs#rules) (in JSON format) for checking JavaScript files
  * You will need to amend the `jscs` task in `gulpfile.js` to run against a JavaScript file of your choosing that resides within `/app/scripts`
  * Open a terminal within your project directory and type in `gulp jscs` to run the associated task

---

## BrowserStack

* If you're doing any cross-browser testing with BrowserStack's local setup, you can edit when running `$ gulp` and live-reload directly inside of a BrowserStack VM.
  * Use `3000` as the port number and untick HTTPS

---

## Chrome and Gulp (Optional)

* Download the [Gulp Devtools extension for Chrome Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gulp-devtools/ojpmgjhofceebfifeajnjojpokebkkji) from the Chrome Web Store
* Open a terminal within your project directory and type in `gulp-devtools`
* Open Chrome Developer tools and find the Gulp tab
  * Your `gulp` tasks should now be accessible to run within Chrome
